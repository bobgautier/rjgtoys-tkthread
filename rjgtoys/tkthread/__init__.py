target is the callable object to be invoked by the run() method. Defaults to None, meaning nothing is called.

name is the thread name. By default, a unique name is constructed of the form “Thread-N” where N is a small decimal number.

kwargs is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target invocation. Defaults to {}.

        Creates and optionally starts a thread that will generate events to
        be processed by tkinter.

        generator: An iterable that will provide the events to be processed.

            It will be called from a new thread, and each value that it generates
            will be put into a queue.

        queue: The queue into which to put the generated events.

            If `None` is passed, a new :class:`EventQueue` is created, using
            the `handler`, `widget` and `maxsize` parameters - see documentation
            for :class:`EventQueue` for descriptions of those.

        start: A boolean that indicates whether the thread should be started.

            The default is to start the thread immediately.  This saves having
            to write an explicit `start()` call.

        group: Should be `None`

            This is reserved for a future extension to :class:`threading.Thread`.

        name: A name for the thread.

            If `None` is passed, a name of the form `EventGenerator-N` is
            used, where `N` is an integer.

        Most of the above parameters will rarely be needed.   The most

                widget=my_toplevel_widget
            )

        This creates a (notionally) unlimited sized queue and feeds events into
        it from `source_of_events`, handling them by calling `handler_of_events`
        from an event handler associated with `my_toplevel_widget`.
